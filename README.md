## What is this?

**100 Days Of Ruby** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about **Ruby** every day during 100 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
-   [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python)
-   [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin)
-   [60 Days Of Shell Script](https://github.com/marcosvbras/60-days-of-shell-script)
-   [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift)

## Why am I doing this?

Well, writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing **efficient**, **clear**, **concise**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding. Because of that, I decided to code every day to get out of my comfort zone and improve my view about the huge world of software development.

## Why Ruby?

The right question is: **Why not Ruby**? Everything is beautiful in **Ruby**: the name, the logo and the syntax, of course. The **Syntax Sugar** is incredible and makes me miss it when I am coding with other programming languages. In addition, Ruby has a huge library amount, a large community and is used by big players (like Github).

So, **let's code**?

## Usage

These examples were compiled with **Ruby 2.5.1**. It is recommended to install this exactly version for a correct running.
