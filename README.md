## What is this?

**100 Days Of Ruby** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about Ruby every day during 100 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
-   [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python)
-   [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin)
-   [60 Days Of Shell Script](https://github.com/marcosvbras/60-days-of-shell-script)
-   [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift)

## Why am I doing this? Why Ruby?

Writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing efficient, clear, concise, scalable, and maintainable code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding.

Everything is beautiful in **Ruby**: the name, the logo and the syntax, of course. The **Syntax Sugar** is incredible and makes me miss it when I am coding with other programming languages. In addition, Ruby has a huge library amount, a large community and is used by big players (like Github). So, let's code?

So, **let's code**?

## Usage

These examples were compiled with **Ruby 2.5.0**, so you need to install this version to correct operation according with was written. Maybe it works with other versions, but I didn't try.
