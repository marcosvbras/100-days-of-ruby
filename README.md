This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes: [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python), [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin), [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift). So, in this repository I learn something new about Ruby every day during 100 days.
